## Transition from Algebrite

The build for [algebrite](https://github.com/davidedc/Algebrite) concatenated files then transpile from coffescript. This project will start with the output file in `dist` from v1.3.0 and work solely on the test library.

Once the test library runs well, the project will focus on migrating algebrite from coffeescript to typescript.
