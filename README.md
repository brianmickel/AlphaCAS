# AnotherCAS

Another computer algebra system. Started from Algebrite v1.3.0. Right now the goal is to make progress on the test library.

## Getting Started

### Installing

## Running the tests

`npm test`

## Built With

- [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - module bundler
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - testing framework
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - code formatter

## Built from Algebrite

The build for [algebrite](https://github.com/davidedc/Algebrite) concatenates files then transpiles from coffescript. This project will start with the output file v1.3.0 from `dist` and work solely on the test library.

Once the test library runs well, the project will focus on creating a typescript version of algebrite. Or maybe something entirely different
